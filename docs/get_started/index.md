# MXNet: A Scalable Deep Learning Framework
MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework that allows you to define, train, and deploy deep neural networks on a wide array of devices, from cloud infrastructure to mobile devices.
It is highly scalable, allowing for fast model training, and supports a flexible programming model and multiple languages. MXNet allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming flavors to maximize both efficiency and productivity.
MXNet is built on a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly.
A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The MXNet library is portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.


# Setup and Installation
You can run MXNet on Amazon Linux, Ubuntu/Debian, OS X, and Windows operating systems. MXNet can be run on Docker and on Cloud like AWS. MxNet can also be run on embedded devices, such as the Raspberry Pi running Raspbian. MXNet currently supports the Python, R, Julia and Scala languages.

If you are running Python/R on Amazon Linux or Ubuntu, you can use Git Bash scripts to quickly install the MXNet libraries and all its dependencies.

Refer below for more details on setting up MXNet:

# Start to use MXNet

While installation for  MXNet and language package is completed, we can run following codes to verify our installation is successful.

## Julia
```julia
julia> using MXNet

julia> a = mx.ones((2,3), mx.gpu())
mx.NDArray{Float32}(2,3)

julia> Array{Float32}(a * 2)
2×3 Array{Float32,2}:
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0
```

## Python

The Python interface is similar to `numpy.NDArray`:

 ```python
    >>> import mxnet as mx
    >>> a = mx.nd.ones((2, 3), mx.gpu())
    >>> print ((a * 2).asnumpy())
    [[ 2.  2.  2.]
     [ 2.  2.  2.]]
 ```

## R

 ```r
    > require(mxnet)
    Loading required package: mxnet
    > a <- mx.nd.ones(c(2,3))
    > a
         [,1] [,2] [,3]
    [1,]    1    1    1
    [2,]    1    1    1
    > a + 1
         [,1] [,2] [,3]
    [1,]    2    2    2
    [2,]    2    2    2
 ```

## Scala

You can perform tensor or matrix computation in pure Scala:

 ```scala
    scala> import ml.dmlc.mxnet._
    import ml.dmlc.mxnet._

    scala> val arr = NDArray.ones(2, 3)
    arr: ml.dmlc.mxnet.NDArray = ml.dmlc.mxnet.NDArray@f5e74790

    scala> arr.shape
    res0: ml.dmlc.mxnet.Shape = (2,3)

    scala> (arr * 2).toArray
    res2: Array[Float] = Array(2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0)

    scala> (arr * 2).shape
    res3: ml.dmlc.mxnet.Shape = (2,3)
 ```
